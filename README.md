then run the code and npm install everything you need inside the terminal: (npm install express)

you will also need to change the api code to your api code aswell as the path.join() file location.

the variable MODELEASY will be a fine tuned model. to fine tune a model you need to go to openAI account and choose fine tuning. use the onlyHTML.jsonl to fine tune a model and copy the name of this new fine tuned model into MODELEASY. (make sure to only use complex if you dont create a model for MODELEASY
